FM Sound Match Experiment
=========================

In progress.

This is where a jupyter notebook of the experiment, as well as links to
download the code and data for this experiment will go.

.. code:: ipython3

    import spiegel

Load Dexed VST, set the note length and render length to be one second.
For this experiment we arenâ€™t worried about the release of the sound,
but you can set the render length longer than the note length to capture
the release portion of a signal. Synthesizer parameters are loaded from
a JSON file that describes all the overrriden parameters and their
values.

.. code:: ipython3

    synth = spiegel.synth.SynthVST("/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST/Dexed.vst",
	                                note_length_secs=1.0,
											  render_length_secs=1.0)
    synth.load_state("./synth_params/dexed_simple_fm.json")

.. code:: ipython3

    features = spiegel.features.MFCC(num_mfccs=13, time_major=True, hop_size=1024)
