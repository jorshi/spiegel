----

An object oriented Python library for research and development related to Automatic
Synthesizer Programming. SpiegeLib contains a set of classes and base classes for
developing and evaluating algorithms for generating parameters and patch settings
for synthesizers.

*SpiegeLib* is named after composer Laurie Spiegel, an early pioneer in electronic music.
She is known for her work with synthesizers and for automating various aspects of
the music composition process. Her philosophy for using technology and automation in music
serves as motivation for this project:

"I automate whatever can be automated to be freer to focus on those aspects of music that can't be automated. The challenge is to figure out which is which."
