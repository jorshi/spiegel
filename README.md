An object oriented Python library for research and development related to Automatic Sound Synthesizer Programming. *SpiegeLib* contains a set of classes and base classes for developing and evaluting algorithms for generating parameters and patch settings for synthesizers.

SpiegeLib is named after composer Laurie Spiegel, an early pioneer in electronic music. She is known for her work with synthesizers and for automating various aspects of the music composition process. Her philosophy for using technology and automation in music serves as motivation for this project:

*I automate whatever can be automated to be freer to focus on those aspects of music that canâ€™t be automated. The challenge is to figure out which is which.*
